#Installation

## Using Sublime Package Control

### Step 1: Install Package Control

Package Control is an essential Sublime Text plugin and can be found at: [https://sublime.wbond.net/installation](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)

Please follow the installation instructions on the page and then restart Sublime Text to complete installation.

### Step 2: Add this GitHub Repository to Package Control

The `sublime-text-2-lsl` plugin is not, by default, available in Package Control, so we need to add it.

Open up Package Control in Sublime Text by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>(windows) or <kbd>⌘+Shift+P</kbd>(mac) and scroll down to the option `Package Control: Add Repository`

When you click on the `Add Repository` option, a textbox will open at the bottom of the Sublime Text window.  Enter the name of this repository without the .git extension: `https://github.com/To-mos/sublime-text-2-lsl`

Press enter.

### Step 3: Install `sublime-text-2-lsl` via Package Control

Now we've added `sublime-text-2-lsl` to our list of available packages, but we haven't installed it yet.

Re-open Package Control by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>(windows) or <kbd>⌘+Shift+P</kbd>(mac) and scrolling down to `Package Control: Install Package`.

Search for the package `sublime-text-2-lsl` and double click on it.

That's it, `sublime-text-2-lsl` is installed and ready to go. No restart of Sublime Text is necessary.

##Using Git

You can locate your Sublime Text `Packages` directory. When inside the `Packages` directory type:

`git clone https://github.com/To-mos/sublime-text-2-lsl sublime-text-2-lsl`

Restart Sublime Text and the package is installed.
